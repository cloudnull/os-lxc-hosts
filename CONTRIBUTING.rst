Pull Request
------------

When submitting a pull request (PR), or reviewing existing PR's in preparation for merge, please ensure the following criteria are met:
    * PR relates to a prior filed issue, and the issue number is included in the body of the PR.
    * The PR (not the issue) is targeted at the relevant milestone. If the PR is against master, target the current/latest milestone.
    * The issue number is NOT in the title of the commit message. The issue MAY be included in the body of the commit message, but not the title.
    * The PR title should be usable to populate the change log.
    * The PR description should clearly describe the functional change being made
    * Unrelated functional changes are submitted separately.
    * Note any limitations of the fix.
    * Fix/feature being added has been coded in a similar style, or taken a similar logical pattern to the rest of the code base.
    * PR should, where possible, relate to a single issue
    * All commits relating to a single issue in a PR are squashed to a single commit.
    * The commit message and PR title should not contain typos
    * The PR should be submitted against the correct branch. If the PR is against master, and the original issue was labeled with 'backport potential', 'cherry-pick -x' the issue from master into the relevant stable branch, and submit a separate PR to that branch



Issues
------

    * Include historical information on how the problem was identified.

    * If the issue is a bug that needs fixing in a branch other than Master, add the ‘backport potential’ tag TO THE ISSUE (not the PR).
    * The provided information should be totally self-contained. External access to web services/sites should not be needed.
    * If the issue is needed for a hotfix release, add the 'expedite' label.
    * Steps to reproduce the problem if possible.
